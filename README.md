Many of us have come across a range of note-taking apps that help us record our day-to-day activities or work-related items. Have you ever wondered what makes these apps popular?

Numerous users are currently embracing note-taking applications because of features in the apps, such as linking different notes together to avoid data duplication. Another great feature is that the note-taking apps will automatically check all of our previous notes to find out if we have made any related notes already. All of these features help the user retain several notes or documents in a sorted way.

Now, Bidirectional Linking is one of the features of these note-taking applications that allows us to connect separate notes together under one category. This makes it easy for the user to check the category, and all the notes linked under it will be shown.

## Note: 
In this tutorial, We are going to use the Fuzzy Search / Fuzzy Sort npm package for searching and displaying the results. Users can use any searching method, but it should return results faster. We are using Angular in this tutorial to implement the same.

## Summary

Using the Bidirectional Linking different notes can be connected together under one group. This makes it easy for a user to check the category, and all the notes linked under it will be shown. This, in turn, helps the user to build notes easily and also prevents data redundancy issues.
